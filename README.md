### 👋 Hi, I’m @MeowFi

- 👀 I’m into backend development and exploring the Solana ecosystem  
- ⚙️ What I’m using right now: **Next.js**, **Rust**, **Elixir**, **TypeScript**, **GraphQL**, **Node.js**, and **PostgreSQL**  
- 🌱 Currently learning: advanced systems design, Solana on-chain programs, and scalable backend architectures  
- 💞️ Looking to collaborate on: backend-heavy web3 projects, distributed systems, and anything that pushes the limits of Rust or Elixir  
- 📫 Reach me on: [Twitter](https://x.com/MeowfiDev) 
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her  
- ⚡ Fun fact: AI won’t take your job—**people who use it will** 😉
